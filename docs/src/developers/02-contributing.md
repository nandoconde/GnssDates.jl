# [Contributing guide](@id contributing)

First of all, thanks for the interest!

We welcome all kinds of contribution, including, but not limited to code,
documentation, examples, configuration, issue creating, tests, etc.

Be polite and respectful, and follow the issue and PR templates to ease the
collaboration process.

## Before starting

We are completely open to new ideas and features, but the core of this package
is providing time management for other GNSS packages in a way that feels both
minimal but feature complete. This means that any new feature should minimize:

- Adding dependencies
- Breaking old code
- Adding different ways to do the same

If you detect an issue with the existing code or have a feature request, please
open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/nandoconde/GnssDates.jl/issues).

!!! tip
    Feel free to ping @nandoconde after a few days if there are no responses.

## How to contribute

If you found an issue that interests you, comment on that issue what your plans
are. If the solution to the issue is clear, you can immediately create a pull
request (see below). Otherwise, say what your proposed solution is and wait for
a discussion around it.

To create the PR, please check the instructions in [Devdocs](@ref), and don't
forget to take all the [necessary steps](@ref checklists).
