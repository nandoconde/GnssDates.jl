# Package dependencies

This package depends directly only on one package outside of the standard
library, [LeapSeconds.jl](https://github.com/JuliaTime/LeapSeconds.jl). It would
be awesome to keep it this way to maximize compatibility with past and future
Julia versions.

Current dependencies are:

- [Dates](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Dates/)
- [LeapSeconds.jl](https://juliatime.github.io/LeapSeconds.jl/stable/)
